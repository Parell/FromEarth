# About FromEarth

<a href="https://github.com/cmdrflexo/RocketFOSS">RocketFoss</a> an open source ksp attempt was abandoned, so ive decided to carry the torch of opensource, and just build a fun game.

**Defeat the enemies home base to win.** The concept is simple and allows for multiplayer. Nbody orbital mechanics "no pached conics". Combat will be similar to "Children of a dead earth" but more reliant on skill. large but simple scope, World, weapons, and a way to get around.
