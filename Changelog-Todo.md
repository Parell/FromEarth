## TODO: ##
- Add a Physics system with: add, create, and remove functions, an Integrator with low error ie. RK4 for runtime, and RKF45 for ploting trajectories, needed its own fixed update loop cause unity only allows step sizes of 1e-4, and finally needs a gpu based function for faster preformance in drawing orbits.

- Added origin frame controller or (floating origin system), capability to set refrence frame of cameras, particals, lines, trails and offset every body after position threshold met, also has a velocity reference frame which keeps main selected body within 2000 m/s. 

- Added functions to control, edit, and design celestial objects. (Not a quad Sphere system yet.)

- Added a way to manage all scaled space objects in editor.

- Added time controls and time warp functions.

- Added Maneuver system were you can click on an orbit point, create a maneuver and have your ship automatically burn the maneuver.

- Added hud UI including a navball, speed, and fuel statistics, plus an acceleration based throttle.

- Added main menu loading screen.

- Added damage system and death sequence for vessels.

- Added weapons controller for Missiles and other intercept crafts.

- Added AI ship control and pilot personas profiles.

- Added game save and load system.
